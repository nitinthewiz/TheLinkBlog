We've been begging Dropbox for a Family plan for years. Individual 1 TB plans do NOT make sense and Dropbox kinda stop caring about home consumers as they chased the Enterprise paycheck.

No word on pricing, and they've only teased us with word of a private beta. In the words of [Roberto Mateu](https://5typos.net/dropbox-password-manager-file-vault-and-family-plan-announced), *too little too late*.
