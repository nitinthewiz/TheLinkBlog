It's pretty stupid that FB's 'bold new vision' for privacy is all about two things - groups and events. It's stupid because - 

1. It's not. It's really not. Facebook has had years to get Events front and center. It can be the powerhouse in that field. But I can clearly see that terrible video tab. And I can see that Stories are front and center.

2. Groups. That's cute. WhatsApp circa 2010 you mean? Groups have existed forever. Relabeling the UI and putting Groups to the center is nice, but it doesn't solve the problem of privacy or hate speech.

Also, Facebook killed their awesome Groups app years ago. Now they want to bring it back? What happened? All else failed? Bah.
