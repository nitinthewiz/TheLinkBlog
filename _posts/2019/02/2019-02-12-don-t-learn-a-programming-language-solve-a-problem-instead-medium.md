>> The thing is that the details of how to build something are worthless compared to reasons why you need to build something.

I believe that when you’re learning a new language, the best way to do this is to pick up a real world problem you’re trying to solve, boil it down to the simplest version of the thing (no remote hosting, no paid API access, etc) and just build it as you go about learning the language.

When I learned python, I didn’t learn the ins and outs of python before I built something. I tossed the python language books into the trash and just built something, going along as I did. This is not the ‘right way’ of leaning Computer Science, but most of us aren’t trying to learn computer science, we’re trying to build stuff.

So this is great advice.
