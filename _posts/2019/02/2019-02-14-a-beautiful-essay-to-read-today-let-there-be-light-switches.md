> As is often the case with unthinking smart systems, it is a highly individualising interface, revealing no trace of others.

[Let There Be Light Switches — R / D](https://www.readingdesign.org/let-there-be-light-switches/)

What a beautiful essay about light switches and light and darkness and design. Beautiful intersection of things and ideas. Also takes a dig at smart systems for being hyper-impersonal while being highly individualistic. Hence the beautiful and dark quote above.
