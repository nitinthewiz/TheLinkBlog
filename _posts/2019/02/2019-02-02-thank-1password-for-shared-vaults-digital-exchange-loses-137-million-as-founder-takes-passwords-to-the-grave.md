Yikes. This should not happen. There need to be backups of everything, including passwords, no matter how blockheaded that feels. If nothing else, 1Password shared vaults should allow important access. Or, if youâ€™re sitting on $137 million in a computer, you better have the password of the device written down and sitting in a vault!

RIP Gerry.
