“Amazon Crossing introduces readers to authors from around the world with translations of foreign language books, making award-winning and best-selling books accessible to new readers.”

This is amazing! What’s also interesting is that Amazon has sorted the books into “from countries”, typical categories like “historical fiction”, and you can filter to Kindle Unlimited or Prime Reading. All great ways to get your hands on interesting reading from other countries and perspectives.

This has existed since 2010 and today is the first I’ve seen it! It’s ridiculous that Amazon has all these amazing things going on in the background and some of us don’t even know!
