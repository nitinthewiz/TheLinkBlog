> CC Search is out of beta with 300M images

This is pretty awesome. I love using Unsplash to find beautiful images for my blogposts on WordPress. I use the Instant Images to do so. Hopefully this new Search tool will have API access that plugins will get built around and we'll be able to access some amazing photos from around the world!
