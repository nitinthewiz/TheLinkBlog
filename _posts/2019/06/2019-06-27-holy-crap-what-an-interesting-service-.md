People always find me to ask - does this phrase look right? Most of the time, I end up doing a Google search for the phrase and if it's been used enough historically (specially in Google Books) then it's fine to use today.

This service automates that process in a great way! A simple search reveals similar strings, common uses, etc. Love it!

Paired with Hemingwayapp and Gingkoapp, the web is becoming a powerful place to write! (Scrivener beware!)
