> When thereâ€™s just too much video streaming content to choose from, viewers turn to a trusty old friend: broadcast television. 

Hogwash. I don't __have__ broadcast TV, and don't intend to ever, and I suspect more and more people are turning to that. My theory? When we find nothing to watch, we go into mindless browsing mode, and there's nothing better for that than YouTube. Check those numbers!
