Oh, I just 💙 this! A small shell command that will create a JSON object? What a perfect embodiment of the Unix philosophy of chaining small things together to make powerful things. This is a super handy utility to place at the end of your shell scripts or to create a solid interface between systems or services. Nifty! 👏
