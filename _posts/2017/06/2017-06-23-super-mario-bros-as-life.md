*Wow!* This is really cool. This is one of the more interesting [AR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) game demos I've seen. The whole time I was watching this I was wondering how this would look for [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/). It’s notable that he never goes up on any platforms in the demo though. Gravity still matters. 😁
