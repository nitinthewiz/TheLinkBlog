I just discovered Kill the Newsletter and used it to get an RSS feed of recomendo.com
I can't bear to have more email flooding my inbox than already shows up and I've actively avoided newsletters before this point! I can't believe I've never gone looking for something like this before. But all's well that ends well, I think.

Hopefully Kill the Newsletter will do its thing for a long time to come! :)
