Thread by @morganknutson -

This is an excellent read on the pathos in Google from the point of view of a designer. It's a twitter thread, so I've linked threadviews instead.

There are two services I've seen that collect threads on twitter. I wonder which one you'd prefer -

[threadreaderapp](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1049523067506966529.html)

or

[threader](https://threader.app/thread/1049523067506966529)

Now that Workflow has been relabeled as Shortcuts, there are websites popping up that deal with sharing the same -

[shortcutsgallery](https://shortcutsgallery.com/?_sort=popular)

[sharecuts](https://sharecuts.app/)

People are really loving the dot app domains, it seems!

We were having a conversation around offline reading, PDFs, notes, annotations and the such recently. I've been looking at [Polar](https://getpolarized.io/) for a while now. Worth downloading and using?
