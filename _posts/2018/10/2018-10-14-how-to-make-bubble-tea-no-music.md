My new favorite YouTube channel - Peaceful Cuisine. 

The last thing I truly liked on YouTube/Netflix was Slow TV and it’s amazing train journeys. 

This channel is just as therapeutic. The sounds in the No Music versions are all just the chopping, pouring, scooping of the ingredients. It’s amazing!!
