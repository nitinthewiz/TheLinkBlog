This is the first I've seen this feed reader, I think. Reeder supports this using the Fever API. It's both awesome and daunting that so many feed readers out there support the Fever API when Fever is both dead, and had a rather cumbersome API to begin with (it would download the entire block of RSS feed items in one set).
