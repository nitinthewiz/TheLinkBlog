Nice note by The Hustle about Musk's moves to secure his companies from market forces. Musk may be considered a genius, but more importantly, he's a pioneer, with a pioneer's thinking - the grit to find solutions to problems people think are impenetrable.

That's what makes watching his career so interesting.
