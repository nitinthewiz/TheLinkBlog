I hate twitter and Instagram ads because of their absurd frequency. The second tweet and the second post on the respective networks are ads for me. Same, it seems, for CogDog.

This is an interesting way of studying the algorithm and critiquing it. But I won't do it because I've found ways around seeing these ads and I'm happy with the solutions I've found.
