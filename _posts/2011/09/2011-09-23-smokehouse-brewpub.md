The finished brewpub will have several exciting features.  First is an oak bar wrapped around the main beer cooler.  We think the beer serving tanks being the focal point will anchor the brewpub atmosphere and remind customers that the beer in their glasses is brewery fresh.  Another feature is the floor to ceiling windows on most of the front of the building.  This will allow customers to see the hustle and bustle of 38th Street as they enjoy Smokehouse food and brews.  The windows will also expose the brewhouse workspace, and at certain parts of the day you can see the brewing in action.  Last, is a 40-seat patio on the east side of the building.  We understand the need to soak up every moment of the Twin Cities’ beautiful, yet short summers.  And why not do it with a craft beer in hand.
